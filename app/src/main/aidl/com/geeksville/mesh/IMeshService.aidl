/**
This is the public android API for talking to meshtastic radios.

To connect to meshtastic you should bind to it per https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services

The intent you use to reach the service should look like this:

        val intent = Intent().apply {
            setClassName(
                "com.geeksville.mesh",
                "com.geeksville.mesh.service.MeshService"
            )
        }

Once you have bound to the service you should register your broadcast receivers per https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#context-registered-receivers

    // com.geeksville.mesh.x broadcast intents, where x is:

    // RECEIVED_DATA for data received from other nodes.  payload will contain a DataPacket, this action is DEPRECATED (because it sends all received data)
    // far better to instead use RECEIVED.<portnumm>

    // RECEIVED.<portnumm> -  will **only** deliver packets for the specified port number.  If a wellknown portnums.proto name for portnum is known it will be used
    // (i.e. com.geeksville.mesh.RECEIVED.TEXT_MESSAGE_APP) else the numeric portnum will be included as a base 10 integer (com.geeksville.mesh.RECEIVED.4403 etc...)

    // NODE_CHANGE  for new IDs appearing or disappearing
    // CONNECTION_CHANGED for losing/gaining connection to the packet radio
    // MESSAGE_STATUS_CHANGED for any message status changes (for sent messages only, other messages come via RECEIVED_DATA.  payload will contain a message ID and a MessageStatus)

At the very least you will probably want to receive RECEIVED_DATA.

Note - these calls might throw RemoteException to indicate mesh error states
